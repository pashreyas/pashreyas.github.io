Part of a larger project working to identify and track digital biomarkers to predict changes in the progression of ALS. Personal project deals with changes in voice picked up by a microphone (based on a battery of clinical tests) and how they may coordinate to bulbar function changes on the ALSFRS-R scale after clinical testing. Used MATLAB to conduct spectral analysis and look at the frequency and duration of voice exercises from patients, used novel techniques (MFCCs, PCA) to track multiple features. Used calculus and trigonometry to analyze instantaneous rate of change in spectral waves, then compared the results to a base line using the Chi Square Goodness of Fit statistical test and linear regression (different contexts).
